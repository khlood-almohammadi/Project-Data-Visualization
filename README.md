# Project-Data-Visualization
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. 


## 1) In the first part:

we will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.



## 2) In the second part :
we will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in our selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming our exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.


## 3) What do I need to install?

This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that we use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 4) Why this project?

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that we will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help we approach any statistical analyses and will help we build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed. Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help we be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to we by others.
What will I learn?

## 5) After completing this project, we will be able to:

Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing we to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
- Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
    
  

## The following questions will be discussed:
A - for " years - months ":

1) How will the data for the years be analyzed ?

2) What are the years in which the number of trips increased ?

3) In the 1990s and 1980s, what years did you record a large number of flights?

4) What are the most effective months for trips?

5) What are the years that recorded the highest record after 1/1/2000 ?

6) What are the months affected the most by the aviation industry?

7) What is the conclusion and perception of the increase in the number of years and the number of trips during the mentioned period ?
B - the manufacturer's :

1) What are the most powerful companies in the aviation industry?

2) What were the manufacturer's statistics before 1/1/2000?

3) What are the manufacturer's statistics after 1/1/2000?

4) Based on the statistics, what are the expectations of increased growth between companies?

..

C- The Model :

1) From 1976 to 2008 what are the three most popular models among airlines ?!

2) What are the models most used in the aviation industry?

3) What are the models that were relied upon before 1/1/2000?

4) What are the models adopted in the aviation industry after 1/1/2000?
D- Type :

1) What was the most popular type 1976-2008?

2) What is the most common type 1976-2000?

3) What is the most common type 2000-2001?

4) What are the strongest manufacturers of the Corporation type ?!

5) What are the strongest manufacturers of the Individual type ?!
E- Engine Type :

1) What are the most popular types of engines in 1976-2008?

2) What types of engines were used in 1976-2000?

3) Comparison of Demand for Engine Types in the "Pre-2000 and Post-2000" Periods :
F- Manufacturer BOEING :

1) What are the most active years?

2) What is the growth of the company ?! Is it a positive or negative relationship ?

3) What are the most used models?

4) What are the most common engines?

5) What is the most effective month?



# Conclusions in general :

1) We note that the trips began in 1976

2) Data recorded from 1976 to 2008

3) The most active year in air travel is 2004, when 454 different flights were witnessed

4) Compared to the years of the millennium, 1999 and 1998 were good years with significant air traffic activity

5) Relative to the increase in the aviation industry, we notice a direct change in the number of years and an increase in flights.

6) The percentage of activity witnessed in 2004 = 10%, and it was an increase of 3% over the year 2007

.. 

## Before 1/1/2000:

1) The aviation industry has been heavily dependent on the DC-9-82 (MD-82), 118 aircraft

2) The second most common model is the 737-3H4, which was applied to 106 aircraft

3) The third most common model is the MD-88, which has been applied to 91 different aircraft
## After 1/1/200:

1) The most common model is the CL-600-2B19, it has been applied to 319 aircraft

2) In second place the 737-7H4 model, it was applied to 244 aircraft

3) In third place, the A320-232 model was applied to 204 aircraft
Perceptions:



We must note that the model industry has been greatly affected by the progress of the years and the development of technology and heavy engines, so it cannot be judged at all that the models in the years 2000 are the best or that the models in the time of the 90's were ok! Science has advanced and technology has evolved a lot after the millennium years, so it is not fair to compare which is better now because models are not static. They have changed with the change of years.
